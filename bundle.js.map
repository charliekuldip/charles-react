We were tasked by our client, Donroy Entertainment, to create an engaging online experience to help generate buzz around Iris Warriors, while giving them a tool to build an audience in the social space around the question, \\“Which warrior are you?\\\" Our main challenge was that the film had not been shot, so we needed an experiential way to illustrate this abstract concept with no media assets. Our solution was binary. By breaking down each chapter of the story to its core meaning, we were then able to bring this essence to life visually using code. Combined together, they formed a beautiful storytelling technique. Prior to allowing users to experience the story, we gave them the opportunity to learn about the different characters in the film, and choose a warrior that suits them best. After choosing their warriors and providing minimal user data, they are then plotted using google maps, allowing our clients to not only geo-target their audience, but also market to them based on their chosen warrior. These warriors become a user's social identity while they navigate throughout the digital experience.

This exciting brief challenged our team to concept, design and develop the new look \\\"About Our Company\\\" section of gm.com site that would inspire the new website's look and feel. Our goal was to visually enhance an information-heavy experience, to ultimately tell a more engaging and interactive story across desktop, tablet and mobile platforms. During our R&D phase our team created animated prototypes and used a creative prototyping technique called \\\"video-lization\\\" to communicate and bring to life our creative vision. We also created a series of customized SVG animations to visually communicate important GM brand values such as \\\"Our Company\\\", \\\"Our People\\\", \\\"Our Brands\\\", and \\\"Our Commitment\\\". From a Technology standpoint our team formulated development solutions that enhanced the overall user experience across various devices and browsers. To prevent conflict with the existing GM codebase, the technology team wrote a custom-tailored mobile-first framework utilizing CSS3 animations and transforms in combination with scroll-controlled features and SVG graphics. The result is a seamless experience delighting the user as they scroll, revealing eye-catching animations to carry the dialog of GM’s story and further establish their reputation as trend-setters in their industry.\",\n\t  img_src: \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.clickfiremedia.com/images/modules/banner-image/GM_header.jpg\",\n\t  id: \"gm\",\n\t  images: ['General Motors | About.png']\n\t}, {\n\t  name: \"Gamut\",\n\t  bio: \"To transfer a new brand vision into reality, ClickFire Media partnered with CO-OP Marketing to rebrand COX Digital Solutions and craft them a new website.

Our response was to leverage the power of storytelling across the digital and social landscape, by amplifying video content and tailoring the topics of conversation to connect to a wider audience. With the call-to-action: “Hear our stories. Share yours,” Click3x Director Jonathan Yi and ClickFire Media brought together individuals, their families and supporters to capture a two-way conversation. Through authentic narrative and hours of moving footage, audiences learned that cancer is not a solitary struggle; it affects us all. The hours of moving footage led to the creation of a campaign trailer and 27-minute documentary. Users around the world visited the responsive BCACampaign.com website, built ground up with consistent performance from mobile to desktop. It was then translated into 15 different languages, to share stories, photos, videos and opinions resulting in an aggregated live feed that engaged a global audience. The resulting metrics were astounding - 1,000,000 YouTube views, 2,000,000 social media impressions, and 16,000 moments of engagement demonstrating the power of storytelling to transcend space, time and location.\",\n\t  img_src: \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.clickfiremedia.com/images/modules/banner-image/bca_header.jpg\",\n\t  id: \"bca\"\n\t}];\n\t\n\texports.default = ProjectList;\n\t\n\t/* REACT HOT LOADER */ }).call(this); } finally { if (false) { (function () { var foundReactClasses = module.hot.data && module.hot.data.foundReactClasses || false; if (module.exports && module.makeHot) { var makeExportsHot = require(\"/Users/wenzhang/Documents/Works/charles-react/node_modules/react-hot-loader/makeExportsHot.js\"); if (makeExportsHot(module, require(\"react\"))) { foundReactClasses = true; } var shouldAcceptModule = true && foundReactClasses; if (shouldAcceptModule) { module.hot.accept(function (err) { if (err) { console.error(\"Cannot apply hot update to \" + \"projects.js\" + \": \" + err.message); } }); } } module.hot.dispose(function (data) { data.makeHot = module.makeHot; data.foundReactClasses = foundReactClasses; }); })(); } }\n\n/***/ },\n/* 288 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t/* REACT HOT LOADER */ if (false) { (function () { var ReactHotAPI = require(\"/Users/wenzhang/Documents/Works/charles-react/node_modules/react-hot-api/modules/index.js\"), RootInstanceProvider = require(\"/Users/wenzhang/Documents/Works/charles-react/node_modules/react-hot-loader/RootInstanceProvider.js\"), ReactMount = require(\"react-dom/lib/ReactMount\"), React = require(\"react\"); module.makeHot = module.hot.data ? module.hot.data.makeHot : ReactHotAPI(function () { return RootInstanceProvider.getRootInstances(ReactMount); }, React); })(); } try { (function () {\n\t\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t\tvalue: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _NavLink = __webpack_require__(247);\n\t\n\tvar _NavLink2 = _interopRequireDefault(_NavLink);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?
