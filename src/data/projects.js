    bio: "Iris Warriors is many things – a film, a ballet, a book, but above and beyond everything else, it is a creation myth about the birth of color. We were tasked by our client, Donroy Entertainment, to create an engaging online experience to help generate buzz around Iris Warriors, while giving them a tool to build an audience in the social space around the question, \“Which warrior are you?\" Our main challenge was that the film had not been shot, so we needed an experiential way to illustrate this abstract concept with no media assets. Our solution was binary. By breaking down each chapter of the story to its core meaning, we were then able to bring this essence to life visually using code. Combined together, they formed a beautiful storytelling technique. Prior to allowing users to experience the story, we gave them the opportunity to learn about the different characters in the film, and choose a warrior that suits them best. After choosing their warriors and providing minimal user data, they are then plotted using google maps, allowing our clients to not only geo-target their audience, but also market to them based on their chosen warrior. These warriors become a user's social identity while they navigate throughout the digital experience. The Iris Warriors film is currently in production and is scheduled to premiere in early 2017, but we’ve given Donroy Entertainment a head start to building an audience with an engaging online experience and powerful marketing tool.",

I wrote custom animations for the page transitions by manipulating the svg path element attributes. I installed Google Analytics via npm to keep a track on page visits, React Router to take caure of urls and page routing, and structured the code using ES6 modules.

An initiative that gives conEdison control of a building’s energy consumption during peak hours, in return for revenue. To make this offer more enticing we offered the users a suite of tools to educate them on these cost savings opportunities and revenue potential.

The kiosk was engineered with a thermal camera--capturing and saving thermal images. Users came to the kiosk, which was operational 24/7 during a 7-day period, throughout the day and well into the evening. We captured thermoselfies of all kinds--from family portraits, to animated vacation-goers, to Jack Sparrow lookalikes and other costume-adorned characters. We filtered the selfies through a moderation tool and into an aggregated gallery. Users received their images via text message, which could then be shared to social media channels. The kiosk also pulled in real-time SickScore data from The Weather Channel--ultimately letting users decide if they were \"sicker\" than Vegas, and encouraging users to discover their hometown SickScores via zipcode entry.",

During our R&D phase our team created animated prototypes and used a creative prototyping technique called \"video-lization\" to communicate and bring to life our creative vision. We also created a series of customized SVG animations to visually communicate important GM brand values such as \"Our Company\", \"Our People\", \"Our Brands\", and \"Our Commitment\". From a Technology standpoint our team formulated development solutions that enhanced the overall user experience across various devices and browsers. To prevent conflict with the existing GM codebase, the technology team wrote a custom-tailored mobile-first framework utilizing CSS3 animations and transforms in combination with scroll-controlled features and SVG graphics. The result is a seamless experience delighting the user as they scroll, revealing eye-catching animations to carry the dialog of GM’s story and further establish their reputation as trend-setters in their industry.",

Our response was to leverage the power of storytelling across the digital and social landscape, by amplifying video content and tailoring the topics of conversation to connect to a wider audience. With the call-to-action: “Hear our stories. Share yours,” Click3x Director Jonathan Yi and ClickFire Media brought together individuals, their families and supporters to capture a two-way conversation. Through authentic narrative and hours of moving footage, audiences learned that cancer is not a solitary struggle; it affects us all. The hours of moving footage led to the creation of a campaign trailer and 27-minute documentary. Users around the world visited the responsive BCACampaign.com website, built ground up with consistent performance from mobile to desktop. It was then translated into 15 different languages, to share stories, photos, videos and opinions resulting in an aggregated live feed that engaged a global audience. The resulting metrics were astounding - 1,000,000 YouTube views, 2,000,000 social media impressions, and 16,000 moments of engagement demonstrating the power of storytelling to transcend space, time and location.",
